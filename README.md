# Emotion-Gen-Classification

A GAN (Generative adverserial Network) model is used to generate a synthetic dataset and analyse its performance.

Then the original and synthetic dataset is merged to perform the classification algorithm.

A concise algorithm using Deep Convolutional Networks is used to train and test the dataset and provide the intended results.
